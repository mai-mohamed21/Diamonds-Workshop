# 💎 Diamonds EDA Project

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🔧 Preprocessing Steps

- ✅ Checked and handled missing & duplicated values
- ✅ Encoded categorical features:
  - `cut` and `clarity`: **Label Encoding** (due to their ordinal nature)
  - `color`: **One-Hot Encoding** (as it's nominal)
- ✅ Scaled numerical features to improve consistency

## 📊 Visualizations

- Distribution plots for price, carat, etc.
- Boxplots to detect outliers
- Heatmaps and correlation matrix
- 2D & 3D scatter plots to explore relationships

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn (for encoding & scaling)
